# My First Website

## Learning Objectives

* Create a well-designed web page using semantic HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
* Apply techniques for validating and debugging web pages.

## Setup
* You can work on your html/css files locally and then upload to this team
  repository when you are done. There is an editor in GitHub, but it is pretty
  "laggy"
* To make your site available, go to "Settings->GitHub Pages" and change the
  source to "master branch".

## HTML Requirements
You will start with HTML and add style with CSS after you have a valid, semantic HTML document.
Create your page in a file called index.html. Your webpage must have the following elements.

* A _title_.
* A _level one heading_ with your names.
* A _horizontal rule_.
* Summarize the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in web development. Write one _paragraph_ for each.
* Links (aka. _anchors_) to 3 helpful html and css resources. Add a _title attribute_ to each link giving a brief description of the resource.
* _Images_ of your favorite animals that _link_ to the wikipedia page for that animal. Don't forget your _alt attributes_ for accessibility. Not everyone can see images.
* _Emphasize_ some text somewhere.
* Make some text _strong_.
* Display the _pre-formatted_ code for a Java "Hello World!" program.
* A _table_ containing data of your choice.
* Copyright (Â©) your page.
* A _bulleted list_ with answers to the following questions (hint: use the google chrome inspector) to find the answers.
  * Which elements are block elements and which elements are inline? How do you know?
  * What is the default margin of the body element?
  * What are the default font-size and font-weight of the h1 element?
  * How long does it take to load your page?
  * How can you view the response status of the requested resources (e.g. images in this case)?

### Validating your HTML

Before you start adding CSS to your page, run your HTML through the W3C Markup Validation Service. Fix any errors.

## CSS Requirements

Create your style sheet in a file called style.css and link the external style sheet in your HTML head section.
Use the chrome inspector to view the style of the elements as you make changes. Your webpage must have the following
style definitions.

* Change the _background color_ of the entire page (body).
* Change the _font_ of the entire page.
* Change the _font_ of your headers to a different font than the page.
* Play with the _font-size_ of your headers.
* Use _group selectors_ to change the text _color_ of all list items and paragraphs.
* Change emphasized text to a different color so it stands out more.
* Modify the _alignment_ of your headers (e.g. center, left, justify, right).
* Change the _list style type_ of your bulleted list.
* How can you change it for only the sublist items?
* Add more space between list items.
* Remove the underline from the links on your page. How can you still make them look like links without the underline?
* Round the edges of your images so they look cooler.
* Change the opacity of the images when you hover over them.
* Change the background color of your "Hello World!" code and add a border around it. Play with padding and margin to see how they affect the element.
* Add borders and padding to your table.
* How can you view the response status of the requested resource (e.g. style.css in this case)?

### Validating your CSS
