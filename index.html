	<h2>HTML</h2>
	<p>HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language, is used by the web browser to provide a semantic description of the content of the page and establish the structure of the document. HTML does not concern itself with the presentation of the document in the browser.</p>

	<br>

	<h2>CSS</h2>
	<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, IS interested in the presentation of the webpage. It is a language for describing the colors, layouts, and fonts (to name a few) of the content.</p>

	<br>

	<h2>JavaScript</h2>
	<p>JavaScript is an object scripting language which is used in web pages that allows dynamic content to be executed. Javascript can be used to include more complex scripts than HTML or CSS can provide.</p>
